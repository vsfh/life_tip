Dear Prof. Xu:

Hi! I am Feihong Shen, a graduate from Jilin University, where I majored in Software Engineering. Currently, I am employed at an Artificial Intelligence company located in Hangzhou.
Being desirous to further pursue my research interests, I have decided to apply for the PhD program in 2025.

I am very interested in your research on computer vision and trustworthy AI, and I read your paper published recently on Adversarial Consistency Models. 
Since I have also been involved in some research projects within the same field, I do hope to join your group and work under your supervision.
I would like to know whether or not you would enroll graduate students for doctoral degree in 2025? It would be great if you could kindly reply to this email at your earliest convenience.

My CV is in the attachment for your reference. Thank you very much for your time. I am looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best Regards,
